# Clojure Project

We will create a very simple Sales Order application in this project to gain experience with the functional programming language Clojure.
In fact, it will only load data from a set of three disc files. This information will then be used to populate your Sales database.

## Installation

In order to run this program, we need to install clojure in our system by following this link:

`https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure`

Once Clojure has been installed we can run our program by using these two commands after cloning this repository :

 `export CLASSPATH=./`

 `clojure app.clj`
